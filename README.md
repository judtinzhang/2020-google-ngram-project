# Description

The number of English-speakers worldwide is growing rapidly. As the language is
becoming a more prevalent medium of global communication, research on this language seems
appropriate. The study intends to evaluate the American English language to better understand
the different variations English has undergone throughout the centuries. This studyâ€™s purpose is
to develop a computer algorithm that can discern between different time frames based on
literature. The goal of the algorithm is to associate patterns with certain times and thus have the
ability to approximate the relative age of a certain document. By analyzing sentence structure
and word usage specifically, the algorithm has the possibility of presenting data on how the
English language has evolved. Applications of this algorithm include understanding the modern
variations of the American English language, restoring a certain piece of text to its correct
position in the timeline, and evaluating the changes in diction complexity as time progresses.
Understanding sentence structure and word usage are vital in deducing how the English language
has changed and affected society. The results of the experiment reveal that the computer
algorithm not only can deduce the differences between time periods based on sentence structure,
but also can successfully correlate documents with their respective time periods. In fact, the
algorithm outputted data regarding sentence structure that produced near-zero p-values. As for
document correlation, the algorithm, on average, yielded an error of only 29 years out of the
400-year time frame.
